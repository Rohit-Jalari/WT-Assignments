Qn.1 ) To print a table in php using class and object.
      - For this, we created three different files. Two of them are class named as Employee.php and Company.php. We included these two files in the third file named as detail.php.Then we created objects and used foreach loop to print in table form.

Qn.2:To print first 20 even numbers.
    - In order to obtain even numbers we initialize a number =2 and tested condition using using if ..statements .If the condition is satisfied then we increment the number by 2 and loop 20 times to get the required number of even numbers.

Qn.3:Illustrate associative array and for each loop.
    - Associative array are the arrays that use named keys that programmer assign to them.It can alo be defined as array with strings as index.This stores elements values in association with key values rather than in strict linear index order.They can establish a strong association between key and values. 

Qn.4: Illustrate String Functions and Array functions. 
    - String functions and array function used in the code are given below :
    - String functions :  a. strlen() = return length of the string
                          b. chunk_split() = splits a string into a series of smaller parts.
                          c. strrev() = reverses the string
                          d. strtoupper() = converts string to upper case.
                          e. strtolower() = converts string to lower case.
    - Array functions :   a. arsort() = sorts the array in descending order.
                          b. asort() = sorts the array in ascending order.
                          c. count() =returns the number of elements in an array

Qn.5:Demonstrate the use of array sort in PHP.
      -Different array sorting functions are used in the code.
      asort() = sorts an associative array in ascending order, according to the value
      rsort() = sorts an indexed array in descending order.
      ksort() = sorts an associative array in ascending order, according to the key
      krsort() = sorts an associative array in descending order, according to the key
