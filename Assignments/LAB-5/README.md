1. TO ALTER VISIBILITY OF AN IMAGE IN HTML USING JAVASCRIPT.
  - To alter the viibility of the image, we use Css. Two buttons are made,named as 'Hide' and 'Show'.Onclicking each button, respective functions,'showFunction()' are called.Both functions has the ability to change the visibility of the image using Css property ".style.visibility".

2. TO ILLUSTRATE ELEMENT POSITIONING ANS STACKING ELEMENTS.
  - We included two pictures.With the help of Css(top and left), we placed the image on desired position in 2-dimension space,and z-index to place image in the 3rd dimension.The picture whose z-index is higher appears infront. We used "myFunction(id)" where control statements are used to change the z-index of the image which is clicked.

3. DYNAMIC CONTENTS.
  - Dynamic contents are the contents that can be altered or changed dynamically or during its interaction.We used textarea to take input and upon clicking the button,the input is printed in the paragraph in top.The content can be changed any number of time.

4. DRAG AND DROP
  - One of the powerful event handeling is allowing user to drag and drop elements around the display screen. The mouseup,mousedown,and mousemove events can be used to implement changing top and left properties of an element .

5. FORM VALIDATION
  - Form validation is the process of checking that a form has been filled in correctly before it is processed. In the program,we used control statements which checks if the input in the form is filled correctly. For example,if nothing is given as input, the program will show "Invalid Input" and will print "Submission Unsuccessfull".The program will print "Succesfully Submitted".
